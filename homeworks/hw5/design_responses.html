                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article is the different types of UI interactions for the week. For instance, I see UI interactions that make access to credit cards easier. I also see some UI interactions that make sending money look pretty cool.  </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was the different examples of the UI interactions that I saw. Looking at the different designs really opened my eyes into the different types of designs there are. I really liked seeing people's creativity come to life. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The inspiration with the NIKE shoe size was my favorite. This is because I really liked how you could select your shoe size by scrolling instead of going through a list and clicking. I also thought the interface with the sizes looking like a ruler were very creative. It allowed the user to scroll while also looking at different designs simply by clicking a color. </p>
