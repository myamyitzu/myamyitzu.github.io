<p>Hi! My name is Mya and I am a senior studying Economics and Political Economy at Berkeley. I am from Yangon, Myanmar, and have grown up there my entire life. In my free time, I like to go to cafes, go to the gym, play switch with my roommates, and recently started playing pickleball. I love discovering new music, and my favorite genre is Indie Rock. </p>
